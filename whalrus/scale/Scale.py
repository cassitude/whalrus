class Scale:
    """
    A scale used to evaluate the candidates (for range voting, approval voting, majority judgment, etc).

    This top class represents a generic scale, where two levels of the scale compare according to their internal
    methods `__lt__`, `__le__`, etc.

    For a subclass, it is sufficient to override the method :meth:`lt` and the other comparison methods will be
    modified accordingly (assuming it describes a total order).

    >>> scale.lt(1, 7)
    True
    >>> scale.is_bounded
