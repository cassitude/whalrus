    The weighted majority matrix.

    :param converter: the default is :class:`ConverterBallotToOrder`.
    :param higher_vs_lower: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is ordered higher than candidate ``d``.
    :param lower_vs_higher: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is ordered lower than candidate ``d``.
    :param indifference: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is ordered the same as candidate ``d``.
    :param ordered_vs_unordered: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is ordered and ``d`` is unordered.
    :param unordered_vs_ordered: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is unordered and ``d`` is ordered.
    :param unordered_vs_unordered: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it is unordered and ``d`` is unordered.
    :param ordered_vs_absent: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it ordered and ``d`` is absent.
    :param absent_vs_ordered: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it absent and ``d`` is ordered.
    :param unordered_vs_absent: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it unordered and ``d`` is absent.
    :param absent_vs_unordered: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it absent and ``d`` is unordered.
    :param absent_vs_absent: number of points for candidate ``c`` when it absent and ``d`` is absent.
    :param default_score: default score in the matrix in case of division by 0. In particular, this is used for
        the diagonal coefficients.
    :param antisymmetric: if True, then an antisymmetric version of the matrix is computed (by subtracting the
        transposed matrix).

    An 'unordered' candidate is a candidate that the voter has seen but not included in her ranking; i.e. it is in the
    attribute :attr:`candidates_not_in_b` of the ballot. An 'absent' candidate is a candidate that the voter has not
    even seen; i.e. it is in ``self.candidates_``, but not the attribute :attr:`candidates` of the ballot.

    For all the `scoring' parameters (from ``higher_vs_lower`` to ``absent_vs_absent``), the value None can be used.
    In that case, the corresponding occurrences are not taken into account in the average (neither the numerator,
    not the denominator). Cf. examples below.

    Basic usage:

    >>> ballot = BallotOrder('a > b ~ c', candidates={'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'})
    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(ballots=[ballot]).as_array_
    array([[0. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 1. ],
           [0. , 0. , 0.5, 1. , 1. ],
           [0. , 0.5, 0. , 1. , 1. ],
           [0. , 0. , 0. , 0. , 0.5],
           [0. , 0. , 0. , 0.5, 0. ]])

    In the most general syntax, firstly, you define the matrix computation algorithm:

    >>> matrix = MatrixWeightedMajority(indifference=None)

    Secondly, you use it as a callable to load a particular election (profile, candidates):

    >>> matrix(ballots=['a > b', 'a ~ b'], weights=[2, 1], voters=['Alice', 'Bob'], candidates={'a', 'b'})  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
    <MatrixWeightedMajority.MatrixWeightedMajority object at ...>

    Finally, you can access the computed variables:

    >>> matrix.as_array_
    array([[0., 1.],
           [0., 0.]])

    Later, if you wish, you can load another profile with the same matrix computation algorithm, and so on.

    Using the scoring parameters:

    >>> # With ``indifference = .5`` (default), the ratio of voters who like ``a`` better than ``b`` is 1.5 / 2 = 0.75
    >>> # (the indifferent voter gives .5 point and is counted in the denominator):
    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(['a > b', 'a ~ b']).as_array_
    array([[0.  , 0.75],
           [0.25, 0.  ]])
    >>> # With ``indifference = 0.``, the ratio of voters who like ``a`` better than ``b`` is 1. / 2 = 0.5
    >>> # (the indifferent voter gives no point, but is counted in the denominator):
    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(['a > b', 'a ~ b'], indifference=0.).as_array_
    array([[0. , 0.5],
           [0. , 0. ]])
    >>> # With ``indifference = None``, the ratio of voters who like ``a`` better than ``b`` is 1. / 1 = 1
    >>> # (the indifferent voter is not counted in the average at all).
    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(['a > b', 'a ~ b'], indifference=None).as_array_
    array([[0., 1.],
           [0., 0.]])

    Antisymmetric version:

    >>> MatrixWeightedMajority(['a > b', 'a ~ b'], indifference=None, antisymmetric=True).as_array_
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [-1.,  0.]])
